Northwestern team and Big Ten Conference football highlight films are scattered across the collection from the 1930s through the 1970s."]}}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/3c6c34de-1f66-4993-ae6f-567530bb67cf?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","type":"Canvas","height":1536,"width":2048,"duration":1806.375,"label":{"none":["inu-fball_am_1948_purdue.mov"]},"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/354d074a-9427-4de4-a6f8-31f14115a777/full/!300,300/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","height":300,"width":300,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/354d074a-9427-4de4-a6f8-31f14115a777","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/3c6c34de-1f66-4993-ae6f-567530bb67cf?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/3c6c34de-1f66-4993-ae6f-567530bb67cf?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation/0","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/3c6c34de-1f66-4993-ae6f-567530bb67cf?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","body":{"id":"https://meadow-streaming.rdc.library.northwestern.edu/35/4d/07/4a/-9/42/7-/4d/e4/-a/6f/8-/31/f1/41/15/a7/77/inu-fball_ac_1948_purdue.mov.m3u8","type":"Video","format":"application/x-mpegurl","height":1536,"width":2048,"duration":1806.375}}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/subject/evanston-illinois.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/date/october-2-1948.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/contributor/voigts-bob-contributor.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Northwestern Football vs. Purdue, 1948 - Untitled","description":"Final score, NU: 21, Purdue: 0.
