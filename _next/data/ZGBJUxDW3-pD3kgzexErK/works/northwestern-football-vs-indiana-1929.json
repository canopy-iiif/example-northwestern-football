Northwestern team and Big Ten Conference football highlight films are scattered across the collection from the 1930s through the 1970s."]}}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/564d3d0a-c013-4793-bf3a-3f1751bf5f25?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","type":"Canvas","height":720,"width":1080,"duration":602.055,"label":{"none":["1929_Indiana.mp4"]},"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/6760043d-8ff9-4475-bb23-7eabeb83683d/full/!300,300/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","height":300,"width":300,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/6760043d-8ff9-4475-bb23-7eabeb83683d","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/564d3d0a-c013-4793-bf3a-3f1751bf5f25?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/564d3d0a-c013-4793-bf3a-3f1751bf5f25?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation/0","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/564d3d0a-c013-4793-bf3a-3f1751bf5f25?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","body":{"id":"https://meadow-streaming.rdc.library.northwestern.edu/67/60/04/3d/-8/ff/9-/44/75/-b/b2/3-/7e/ab/eb/83/68/3d/1929_Indiana.m3u8","type":"Video","format":"application/x-mpegurl","height":720,"width":1080,"duration":602.055}}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/subject/northwestern-university-evanston-ill-football-history.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/date/november-16-1929.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/contributor/hanley-dick-1894-1970-contributor.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Northwestern Football vs. Indiana, 1929 - Untitled","description":"Final score: Indiana: 19, NU: 14. Coach: Dick Hanley.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/works/northwestern-football-vs-indiana-1929","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/564d3d0a-c013-4793-bf3a-3f1751bf5f25/thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":300,"alt":"Northwestern Football vs. Indiana, 1929"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
