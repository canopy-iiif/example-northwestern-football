Northwestern team and Big Ten Conference football highlight films are scattered across the collection from the 1930s through the 1970s."]}}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0341a5e2-869c-472e-a380-a757a6098dc3?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","type":"Canvas","height":480,"width":720,"duration":2321.52,"label":{"none":["1973_NU-vs-Iowa.mov"]},"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/eaa0b6c6-a4c7-4611-9d5a-6f3397f04f98/full/!300,300/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","height":300,"width":300,"service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/posters/eaa0b6c6-a4c7-4611-9d5a-6f3397f04f98","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0341a5e2-869c-472e-a380-a757a6098dc3?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation-page","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0341a5e2-869c-472e-a380-a757a6098dc3?as=iiif/canvas/access/0/annotation/0","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","target":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0341a5e2-869c-472e-a380-a757a6098dc3?as=iiif/canvas/access/0","body":{"id":"https://meadow-streaming.rdc.library.northwestern.edu/ea/a0/b6/c6/-a/4c/7-/46/11/-9/d5/a-/6f/33/97/f0/4f/98/1973_NU-vs-Iowa.m3u8","type":"Video","format":"application/x-mpegurl","height":480,"width":720,"duration":2321.52}}]}]}],"logo":[{"id":"https://iiif.dc.library.northwestern.edu/iiif/2/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003/full/pct:50/0/default.webp","type":"Image","format":"image/webp","height":139,"width":1190}]},"related":["https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/subject/northwestern-wildcats-football-team.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/date/october-13-1973.json?sort=random","https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/api/facet/contributor/pont-john-contributor.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Northwestern Football vs. Iowa, 1973 - Untitled","description":"Final score, NU: 31, Iowa: 15. Coach: John Pont.","canonical":"https://canopy-iiif.github.io/example-northwestern-football/works/northwestern-football-vs-iowa-1973","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0341a5e2-869c-472e-a380-a757a6098dc3/thumbnail","type":"image/jpeg","width":300,"height":300,"alt":"Northwestern Football vs. Iowa, 1973"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
